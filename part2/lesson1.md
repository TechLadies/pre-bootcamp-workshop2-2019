# Lesson 1 - Node prompt

You can run random JavaScript code with NodeJS just like in the Chrome Developer JavaScript Console.

## Exercise 1.1

1. Open your Terminal (or Command Prompt in Windows)
2. Type:

    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
    
    You should see this in the next line:
    
    ```bash
    v10.16.0
    ```

3. Let's get into an interactive Node prompt

    Type:
    
    ```bash
    node
    ```

4. You will not go into an interactive Node prompt and you can try to type the stuff from the exercises in [Part 1: Lesson 2](../part1/lesson2.md) here.
