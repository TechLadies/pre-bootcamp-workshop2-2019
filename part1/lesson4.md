# Lesson 4 - Adding Artificial Intelligence (control structure, flow controls, if... else, switch)

In this lesson, we will be switching back to using Visual Studio Code and editing in the HTML file.

## Exercise 4.1

**Scenario:** My software speaks to me

**Objective:**

- Learn about controling the flow of your app
- Use controls to alter the inner workings of your software

**Steps:**

1. Create a new file and name it `lesson4.html`
2. Copy and paste this into your HTML file:

	```html
	<!doctype html>
	<html lang="en">
	  <head>
	    <meta charset="utf-8">
	    <title>Lesson 4</title>
	  </head>
	  <body>
	    <script>
	    	// A single line of comment
	    	
	    	/*
	    	Some multi-line comments here
	    	Handy for making some interesting comments
	    	*/
	    </script>
	  </body>
	</html>
	```

3. Now open the page in your browser.
